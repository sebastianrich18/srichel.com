    <h2>About Me</h2>
    My name is Sebastian Richel, and I'm 18 years old.
    I am a computer science major at the Univeristy at Buffalo.
    I live in Lancaster, New York, which is only 20 minutes from UB.
    I love to program, you can check out my Github
    <a href="https://github.com/sebastianrich18" target="_blank">here.</a>
    I am very intrested in AI, and have messed around with it a little already.
    You can see some of the AI projects I've worked on below.

    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <div class="demo">
      I made an AI that plays the game 'flappy bird' better than any human, which you can play with.
      If you want to see the code, you can find it
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/sebastianrich18/sketches/43IR0D74j" target="_blank">here.</a>
      Each bird is powered by a neural network. When the last bird dies, it becomes the parrent of the next generation.
      It's neural net is changes very slightly and then is passed on to its children. This creates a "survival of the fittest"
      situation where over time, the birds become more and more tuned. The highest score accieved by one of these birds was 250 thousand,
      and it never even died. It was flapping away for almost 3 hours and I just turned it off because I was confident it wasn't going to die.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="demo">
      I also made an AI that plays 'snake' but it doesn't work nearly as well as flappy bird did.
      You can also check out the code for snake
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/sebastianrich18/sketches/JozH0U-cA" target="_blank">here.</a>
      It uses the same neural net as flappy bird, in the same way. I think that was the biggest reason it doesn't work as well.
      In flappy bird, every bird is in the same game world. But with snake, each snake needs its own world. This creates a tricky problem
      of determining which snake should be selected to pass it's altered neural to when a snake dies.
